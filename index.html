    <p>Hey there,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm Alex. A Minneapolis-based user researcher and experience designer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I was formally trained in user research and design at Indiana University's H.C.I.d Masters program.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Much of my professional work has been researching and designing enterprise software and applications (with specializations in health care and logistics). But I love designing in areas ranging from product to VR.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>My dream is to make the Twin Cities one of the next design centers of the world. To achieve this, I am currently mentoring new designers in the Twin Cities.</p>
    <p></p>
